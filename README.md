# Predicting-Equity-Index-Volatility
Analysed macroeconomic, market variables, and lagged volatility to forecast daily S&amp;P 500 volatility over 10+ years. Used non-linear (DecisionTreeRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, ControBurn) and linear models (Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net), comparing them to GARCH. Linear models outperformed non-linear models and GARCH.
